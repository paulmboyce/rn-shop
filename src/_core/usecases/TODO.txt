Lets see of we can pull in some services here from the Reducers...??

Basically:

- Actions:
  - map to Controllers
  - thought they may also "get" data from state or IO/Database etc
- Reducers:
  - map to Use Cases
  - receive Action Type "commands" 
  - with data in payloads 
  - ... so they can ... "perform the Use Cases"

  More:
  ========
1. Now we have CartInteractor, it "should" deal with entities?
2. It should update STATE to data store (via Gateway)

Lets get ProductInteractor and OrderInteractor...
